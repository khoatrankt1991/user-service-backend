# Repository Interfaces & Use Cases

## What was created in this part:

### 🗄️ Repository Interface
- **UserRepository**: Comprehensive interface for data access
- Pagination and filtering support
- Search functionality
- User existence checking
- CRUD operations with domain entities

### 🎯 Use Cases (Application Business Logic)
- **CreateUser**: User registration with validation and conflict checking
- **GetUser**: User retrieval with privacy controls and authorization
- **UpdateUser**: Profile updates with permission validation
- **DeleteUser**: Soft delete with business rules enforcement
- **ListUsers**: Admin-only user listing with pagination
- **LoginUser**: Authentication with security checks
- **SearchUsers**: User search with filtering options
- **LinkSocialAccount**: Social media account linking with conflict detection

### 🧪 Comprehensive Testing
- Unit tests for CreateUser use case with mocking
- Unit tests for LoginUser use case with authentication flows
- Test coverage for validation, authorization, and business rules
- Proper dependency mocking and isolation

### 🏗️ Architecture Features
- **Clean Dependencies**: Use cases depend only on repository interfaces
- **Single Responsibility**: Each use case handles one business operation
- **Authorization Logic**: Built-in permission checking
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and business rule enforcement
- **Immutable Operations**: Use cases coordinate but don't mutate directly

## Key Design Patterns:
✅ **Repository Pattern**: Abstract data access with clean interfaces  
✅ **Use Case Pattern**: Single responsibility business operations  
✅ **Dependency Injection**: Use cases receive dependencies via constructor  
✅ **Command Pattern**: Request/Response objects for use case inputs/outputs  
✅ **Strategy Pattern**: Pluggable password hashing and token generation  

## Business Rules Implemented:
- ✅ User uniqueness validation (email & username)
- ✅ Password strength requirements
- ✅ Email verification requirements for login
- ✅ Account status checks (active, suspended)
- ✅ Authorization rules (self-access, admin-access)
- ✅ Privacy controls for profile visibility
- ✅ Soft delete with business justification
- ✅ Social account conflict prevention

## Git Commits Created:
1. `feat: define UserRepository interface for data access` - Repository interface
2. `feat: implement domain use cases for user management` - All 8 use cases
3. `test: add comprehensive use case unit tests` - Unit tests with mocking

## Architecture Compliance:
✅ **Clean Architecture**: Use cases depend only on abstractions  
✅ **Domain-Driven Design**: Rich business logic in use cases  
✅ **SOLID Principles**: Single responsibility, dependency inversion  
✅ **Testability**: Full unit test coverage with mocking  
✅ **Authorization**: Built-in security and permission checks
